  Sometimes i can't belive the lenght other humans will go to convice them selfs their actions are justified. Sadly it seems the mind of these twisted individuals will preform acts of mental gymnastics that not even sumon biles is capable of executing. Truley looking at the situation and attempting to grasp the true scope and magnituide of these actions i begin to realize the absolute absurdity and insanity of these persons actions. Having someone Attack you and acusce YOU of comitting the act they have commited upon you with absolute pychopathic convition is trueley sad.
  What i have basicly gathed from enduring this kind of behavior has lead me to the conclusion that the main driving force of the attackers actions is from the shame and sadness they feel from commiting the initial crime. This is a perfectly normal reaction for a normal person to feel who has hurt another person or someone they care or love. However this otherwise  normal human reaction appears to be to great a burden for them to live with causing them to lie to them self and justify the wrong doing. Now this is already a level of insansity but what truley elevates this to a whole  other level of insanity is when they project the attacks they comited against the innocent party. It is truley maddening to have to deal with this sort of behavior and is mind blowing to know in your soul and heart that what you are telling the other person is the truth but they blatently assualt you knowing you did nothing wrong and they are the perpitrators
